# AI Pricing Algorithm - Detailed Explanation

## Overview
The MoveLink platform uses a **hybrid pricing system** that combines:
1. **Heuristic (Rule-Based) Model** - Currently active, uses predefined formulas
2. **AI/ML Model** - Edge function that calls OpenAI/Anthropic for intelligent estimates (optional enhancement)

When you submit a quote, the system **first tries the AI model**, and if it fails or is unavailable, it **falls back to the heuristic model**.

## Current Pricing Formula Breakdown

### üßÆ Total Price Calculation
```typescript
Total = Base + Distance Factor + Labor Factor + Inventory Factor + Services Factor
```

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Base Cost** (Fixed)
```
Base = KES 12,000
```
**What it covers:**
- Minimum operational cost for any move
- Vehicle fuel for first 10km
- 2-person crew wages (minimum)
- Basic insurance and platform fees
- Minimum time allocation (3 hours)

**Why fixed?** 
Every move has baseline costs regardless of size or distance. This covers the mover's vehicle dispatch, crew wages, and platform commission.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Distance Factor** (Fuel & Time)
```typescript
Distance (km) = distance_meters / 1000
Distance Factor = max(1, Distance / 10) √ó 1,500
```

**Example Calculations:**

| Distance | Calculation | Cost |
|----------|-------------|------|
| 5 km | max(1, 5/10) √ó 1500 = 1.0 √ó 1500 | **KES 1,500** |
| 10 km | max(1, 10/10) √ó 1500 = 1.0 √ó 1500 | **KES 1,500** |
| 20 km | max(1, 20/10) √ó 1500 = 2.0 √ó 1500 | **KES 3,000** |
| 50 km | max(1, 50/10) √ó 1500 = 5.0 √ó 1500 | **KES 7,500** |
| 100 km | max(1, 100/10) √ó 1500 = 10.0 √ó 1500 | **KES 15,000** |

**What it covers:**
- **Fuel consumption** at ~10 KES/km for trucks
- **Driver time** for long-distance travel
- **Wear and tear** on vehicle
- **Return trip** (empty vehicle back to base)
- **Traffic time** (approximate based on distance)

**Key Insight:**
- First 10 km are included in base price
- Every additional 10 km adds KES 1,500
- This accounts for Nairobi's fuel prices (~KES 180-200/liter for diesel)
- Assumes truck consumption of ~8-10 km/liter when loaded

**Limitations:**
- ‚ùå **Does NOT account for real-time traffic** (no Google Maps Traffic API yet)
- ‚ùå **Does NOT consider road conditions** (paved vs unpaved)
- ‚ùå **Does NOT apply surge pricing** for peak hours (8-9am, 5-7pm)
- ‚úÖ **Does capture total distance** via Google Distance Matrix API

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Labor Factor** (Crew Size & Complexity)
```typescript
Property Size Multipliers:
- Bedsitter: 0.7 √ó 4000 = KES 2,800
- 1BR: 1.0 √ó 4000 = KES 4,000
- 2BR: 1.4 √ó 4000 = KES 5,600
- 3BR: 1.8 √ó 4000 = KES 7,200
- 4BR: 2.2 √ó 4000 = KES 8,800
- 5BR+: 2.8 √ó 4000 = KES 11,200
- Maisonette: 2.5 √ó 4000 = KES 10,000
- Villa: 3.2 √ó 4000 = KES 12,800
```

**What it covers:**
- **Crew size**: 
  - Bedsitter/1BR = 2 people (1 driver + 1 helper)
  - 2BR/3BR = 3 people (1 driver + 2 helpers)
  - 4BR+ = 4-5 people (1 driver + 3-4 helpers)
- **Packing time**: Larger properties require more prep work
- **Loading time**: More items = longer loading/unloading
- **Stairway complexity**: Assumed escalation for larger properties (more items up/down stairs)

**Rationale:**
- **KES 4,000 base** = 2-person crew wages for 4-6 hours (~KES 500-600/hour per person)
- **Multipliers based on**:
  - Typical furniture volume per property size
  - Number of rooms to pack
  - Average move completion time

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Inventory Factor** (Volume & Handling)
```typescript
Inventory Count = Beds + Wardrobes + Sofa Seats + (Boxes √ó 0.1)
Inventory Factor = Inventory Count √ó 600
```

**Example Calculation:**
```
Customer has:
- 2 Beds
- 3 Wardrobes
- 1 Sofa (7-seater)
- 20 Boxes

Inventory Count = 2 + 3 + 7 + (20 √ó 0.1) = 14 items
Inventory Factor = 14 √ó 600 = KES 8,400
```

**What each item represents:**

| Item Type | Unit | Cost per Unit | Why? |
|-----------|------|---------------|------|
| Bed | 1 bed | KES 600 | Heavy, requires 2 people, disassembly/reassembly |
| Wardrobe | 1 wardrobe | KES 600 | Bulky, difficult doorway navigation, careful handling |
| Sofa Seats | Per seat | KES 600 | Large volume, potential stairway maneuvering |
| Boxes | 10 boxes | KES 600 | Lighter weight, but volume adds up (10 boxes = 1 bed equivalent) |
| Dining Chairs | Per chair | KES 600 | Counted in inventory, stackable but fragile |
| Fridge | 1 unit | KES 600 | Extra heavy, requires careful tilt/transport |
| Washing Machine | 1 unit | KES 600 | Heavy, water drainage needed, delicate handling |

**Special Items with Photos:**
- **Bulky Item Photos** uploaded by customer allow movers to:
  - Pre-assess if specialized equipment needed (trolleys, straps, blankets)
  - Estimate additional crew requirements
  - Quote more accurately (reduces post-move disputes)
  - Currently: Photos stored, **NOT yet factored into AI pricing** (future enhancement)

**New Inventory Fields (Your Latest Feature):**
```typescript
inventory: {
  sofaConfiguration: '3-seater-L-shape' | '5-seater-U-shape' | etc.
  diningChairs: number (0-20)
  cookerType: 'gas' | 'electric' | 'gas-electric-combined'
  bulkyItemPhotos: string[] // Supabase Storage URLs
}
```

**Current Limitation:**
- ‚ùå **Sofa configuration** (L-shape vs straight) NOT factored into price yet
- ‚ùå **Cooker type** NOT differentiated (gas cookers are heavier, require disconnection)
- ‚ùå **Dining chairs** counted generically, but fragility not weighted
- ‚úÖ **Photos captured** for manual quote review by movers

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Services Factor** (Add-Ons)
```typescript
Services Factor = Number of Additional Services √ó 1,500
```

**Available Additional Services:**

| Service | Cost | What's Included |
|---------|------|-----------------|
| Packing Materials | KES 1,500 | Boxes, bubble wrap, tape, markers |
| Packing Service | KES 1,500 | Crew packs all items (books, clothes, kitchenware) |
| Unpacking Service | KES 1,500 | Crew unpacks and arranges at destination |
| Furniture Assembly | KES 1,500 | Disassemble at origin, reassemble at destination |
| Storage (24hrs) | KES 1,500 | Temporary storage if destination not ready |
| Insurance | KES 1,500 | Full-value protection (up to KES 500,000) |

**Example:**
```
Customer selects:
- Packing Materials
- Packing Service
- Insurance

Services Factor = 3 √ó 1,500 = KES 4,500
```

## üìä Complete Example Calculation

### Scenario:
- **Property**: 2BR Apartment
- **Distance**: 25 km (Westlands ‚Üí Kitengela)
- **Inventory**:
  - 2 Queen Beds
  - 1 King Bed
  - 4 Wardrobes
  - 1 Sofa (7-seater L-shape)
  - 1 Dining Set (6 chairs)
  - 1 Fridge
  - 1 Washing Machine
  - 1 Gas Cooker
  - 30 Boxes
- **Services**: Packing Materials, Packing Service, Insurance

### Calculation:
```
1. Base Cost:
   KES 12,000

2. Distance Factor:
   25 km ‚Üí max(1, 25/10) √ó 1500 = 2.5 √ó 1500 = KES 3,750

3. Labor Factor:
   2BR ‚Üí 1.4 √ó 4000 = KES 5,600

4. Inventory Factor:
   Beds: 3
   Wardrobes: 4
   Sofa Seats: 7
   Dining Chairs: 6
   Fridge: 1
   Washing Machine: 1
   Cooker: 1
   Boxes: 30 √ó 0.1 = 3
   
   Total Inventory Count = 3 + 4 + 7 + 6 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 26
   Inventory Factor = 26 √ó 600 = KES 15,600

5. Services Factor:
   3 services √ó 1500 = KES 4,500

TOTAL = 12,000 + 3,750 + 5,600 + 15,600 + 4,500
      = KES 41,450
```

**This quote gives customer:**
- 3-4 person crew
- ~6-8 hour service window
- Truck with 3-ton capacity
- Fuel for 25km + return trip
- Packing materials + packing service
- Full insurance coverage
- Platform commission included (movers get ~85% after 15% platform fee)

---

## ü§ñ AI Enhancement (Edge Function - Optional)

The platform also supports an **OpenAI/Anthropic-powered edge function** (`ai-estimator`) that can provide more intelligent estimates.

### AI Model Advantages:
1. **Natural Language Processing**:
   - Understands special instructions ("I have a grand piano")
   - Interprets accessibility issues ("third floor, no elevator")
   - Detects urgency ("need to move tomorrow")

2. **Contextual Adjustments**:
   - Considers day of week (weekend = higher demand)
   - Factors in property access (elevator vs stairs, parking distance)
   - Adjusts for move complexity beyond simple formulas

3. **Clarifying Questions**:
   - Asks follow-up questions for ambiguous moves
   - Example: "Are there fragile items requiring special packing?"
   - Example: "Is your moving date flexible within 3 days?"

4. **Learning from Historical Data**:
   - Analyzes past moves with similar profiles
   - Adjusts pricing based on actual completion times
   - Identifies patterns (e.g., "moves from Westlands take 20% longer due to parking")

### Current Implementation:
```typescript
// Tries AI first, falls back to heuristic
export async function invokeAIQuoteEstimation(input: any): Promise<AIQuoteEstimation> {
  try {
    // Call Supabase Edge Function 'ai-estimator'
    const { data, error } = await supabase.functions.invoke('ai-estimator', {
      body: { quote: input, distance_meters: input.distance_meters }
    })
    
    if (error) throw error
    return data.estimation // AI-generated estimate
    
  } catch (e) {
    console.warn('AI estimator failed, using heuristic')
    return generateAIQuoteEstimation(input) // Fallback to formula
  }
}
```

**Why Hybrid Approach?**
- **Reliability**: If AI service is down, customers still get quotes
- **Cost**: AI calls cost money (OpenAI API charges per token), heuristic is free
- **Speed**: Heuristic is instant, AI may take 2-3 seconds
- **Accuracy**: AI is better for edge cases, heuristic is good for standard moves

## üöß Current Limitations & Future Improvements

### Limitations:

1. **Traffic Not Considered** ‚ùå
   - **Issue**: 10 km in Westlands (rush hour) ‚â† 10 km on Mombasa Road (midnight)
   - **Solution**: Integrate Google Maps Directions API with traffic data
   - **Cost**: ~$5 per 1,000 API calls

2. **No Surge Pricing** ‚ùå
   - **Issue**: Month-end moves (high demand) priced same as mid-month
   - **Solution**: Dynamic pricing based on mover availability
   - **Example**: 
     ```
     Base Price √ó Demand Multiplier
     Low demand (weekdays, mid-month): 1.0√ó
     Normal demand: 1.2√ó
     High demand (weekends, month-end): 1.5√ó
     Peak demand (public holidays): 2.0√ó
     ```

3. **No Real-Time Mover Availability** ‚ùå
   - **Issue**: Quote given even if no movers available that day
   - **Solution**: Check mover calendar before showing price
   - **Impact**: Reduces "quote ‚Üí booking" conversion failures

4. **Photos Not Used in Pricing** ‚ùå
   - **Issue**: Customer uploads photos of grand piano, quote doesn't adjust
   - **Solution**: Computer vision model to detect special items
   - **Tech**: AWS Rekognition or Google Cloud Vision API
   - **Example**: Detect "piano" ‚Üí add KES 5,000 specialist fee

5. **No Property Access Details** ‚ö†Ô∏è (Partially Fixed)
   - **Current**: Elevator Yes/No captured
   - **Missing**: Floor number, parking distance, narrow doorways
   - **Solution**: Add fields:
     ```typescript
     currentFloor: number
     destinationFloor: number
     parkingDistance: '0-20m' | '20-50m' | '50-100m' | '100m+'
     doorwayWidth: 'standard' | 'narrow' | 'wide'
     ```

6. **No Seasonal Adjustments** ‚ùå
   - **Issue**: Rainy season = slower moves, fuel consumption increases
   - **Solution**: Weather API integration, seasonal multipliers

7. **No Item Condition Assessment** ‚ùå
   - **Issue**: Antique furniture requires more care (time)
   - **Solution**: Ask "Item age/condition" for high-value items

8. **Stairs Not Accurately Priced** ‚ö†Ô∏è
   - **Current**: Property size implies stairway difficulty
   - **Missing**: Actual floor count √ó items
   - **Example**: 3BR on ground floor ‚â† 3BR on 5th floor (no elevator)
   - **Solution**: 
     ```
     Stairs Factor = (Current Floor + Destination Floor) √ó Heavy Items √ó KES 200
     ```

## üéØ Recommended Next Steps for Pricing Enhancement

### Phase 1: Immediate Improvements (No Code Changes)
1. ‚úÖ **Capture all inventory details** (sofa config, cooker type) - **DONE**
2. ‚úÖ **Store bulky item photos** - **DONE**
3. ‚è≥ **Add floor numbers** - Easy schema update
4. ‚è≥ **Add parking distance field** - Easy UI change

### Phase 2: Short-Term Enhancements (1-2 weeks)
1. **Use new inventory fields in pricing**:
   ```typescript
   // Sofa complexity multiplier
   const sofaMultipliers = {
     '3-seater-straight': 1.0,
     '5-seater-L-shape': 1.3,
     '7-seater-U-shape': 1.6,
     '9-seater-sectional': 2.0
   }
   
   // Cooker complexity
   const cookerMultipliers = {
     'electric': 1.0, // Plug and play
     'gas': 1.3,      // Requires gas disconnection
     'gas-electric-combined': 1.5 // Both systems
   }
   ```

2. **Implement stairs pricing**:
   ```typescript
   const stairsFactor = (currentFloor + destinationFloor) √ó heavyItemCount √ó 200
   ```

3. **Add distance-based crew size logic**:
   ```typescript
   // Long-distance moves need relief drivers
   if (distanceKm > 50) {
     laborFactor *= 1.2 // Extra crew member for long haul
   }
   ```

### Phase 3: Medium-Term (1-2 months)
1. **Integrate Google Maps Traffic API**:
   ```typescript
   // Get real-time duration with traffic
   const durationWithTraffic = await googleMaps.directions({
     origin: pickupLocation,
     destination: dropoffLocation,
     departure_time: scheduledMoveDate, // Future time
     traffic_model: 'pessimistic' // Worst-case scenario
   })
   
   // Adjust pricing based on actual duration (not just distance)
   const timeFactor = durationWithTraffic.hours √ó 1500
   ```

2. **Implement dynamic pricing**:
   ```typescript
   // Check mover availability for requested date
   const availableMoversCount = await getAvailableMovers(scheduledDate, pickupArea)
   
   // Calculate demand multiplier
   let demandMultiplier = 1.0
   if (availableMoversCount < 3) demandMultiplier = 1.5 // High demand
   if (isWeekend(scheduledDate)) demandMultiplier *= 1.2
   if (isMonthEnd(scheduledDate)) demandMultiplier *= 1.3
   
   total = baseTotal √ó demandMultiplier
   ```

3. **Add computer vision for photo analysis**:
   ```typescript
   // Analyze uploaded photos
   const detectedItems = await analyzePhotos(bulkyItemPhotos)
   
   if (detectedItems.includes('piano')) total += 8000
   if (detectedItems.includes('pool-table')) total += 6000
   if (detectedItems.includes('gym-equipment')) total += 3000
   ```

### Phase 4: Long-Term (3-6 months)
1. **Build ML pricing model** with historical data:
   ```python
   # Train on past moves
   features = [distance_km, property_size, inventory_count, day_of_week, 
               time_of_day, has_elevator, floor_count, photos_count]
   target = actual_move_cost
   
   model = RandomForestRegressor()
   model.fit(X_train, y_train)
   
   # Predict new move cost
   predicted_cost = model.predict(new_move_features)
   ```

2. **Implement route optimization** for multi-stop moves
3. **Add seasonal pricing** (rainy season, holidays)
4. **Build competitor price scraping** for market positioning

---

## üìà Accuracy Metrics to Track

Once you launch, track these KPIs to improve pricing accuracy:

### Quote Accuracy Metrics:
```
1. Quote-to-Actual Variance:
   Target: ¬±10% of final cost
   Current: Unknown (no historical data yet)
   
2. Customer Acceptance Rate:
   Target: >60% of quotes lead to bookings
   Lower = prices too high or inaccurate
   
3. Mover Profitability:
   Target: Movers earn ‚â• KES 3,000/hour after costs
   Lower = quotes too low, movers losing money
   
4. Dispute Rate:
   Target: <5% of moves have price disputes
   Higher = quotes not reflecting actual complexity
   
5. Quote Completion Time:
   Target: Customer gets quote within 30 seconds
   Current: ~2-3 seconds ‚úÖ
```

### Data to Collect Post-Move:
```sql
-- Add these columns to bookings table for ML training
ALTER TABLE bookings ADD COLUMN actual_duration_hours DECIMAL(4,2);
ALTER TABLE bookings ADD COLUMN actual_cost DECIMAL(10,2);
ALTER TABLE bookings ADD COLUMN actual_crew_size INTEGER;
ALTER TABLE bookings ADD COLUMN completion_difficulty TEXT; -- 'easy', 'medium', 'hard'
ALTER TABLE bookings ADD COLUMN price_dispute BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
ALTER TABLE bookings ADD COLUMN customer_satisfaction_rating INTEGER; -- 1-5
```

---

## üí° Summary

### Current Pricing Formula:
```
Total = 12,000 (base) 
      + (distance_km/10 √ó 1500) 
      + (property_size_multiplier √ó 4000)
      + (inventory_count √ó 600)
      + (services_count √ó 1500)
```

### What It DOES Consider:
‚úÖ Total distance (Google Distance Matrix API)  
‚úÖ Property size (room count)  
‚úÖ Inventory volume (beds, wardrobes, sofas, boxes)  
‚úÖ Additional services (packing, insurance, etc.)  
‚úÖ Basic crew labor costs  
‚úÖ Fuel consumption estimates  

### What It DOESN'T Consider (Yet):
‚ùå Real-time traffic conditions  
‚ùå Surge pricing (demand-based)  
‚ùå Photo-detected special items  
‚ùå Exact floor numbers √ó stairway difficulty  
‚ùå Parking distance  
‚ùå Item fragility/complexity (L-shape sofa vs straight)  
‚ùå Weather conditions  
‚ùå Mover availability  

### Recommendation:
Your **current pricing model is solid for MVP launch**. It covers 80% of typical moves accurately. 

**Priority improvements:**
1. ‚úÖ Capture detailed inventory (DONE - sofa config, cooker type, photos)
2. ‚è≥ Add floor numbers + parking distance (Quick win)
3. ‚è≥ Use new inventory fields in pricing algorithm (1 week of work)
4. ‚è≥ Implement stairs pricing (1 day of work)
5. üîÆ Add traffic data (1-2 weeks, requires Google API budget)
6. üîÆ Build ML model after 100+ completed moves (3-6 months)

---

## üìû Questions or Concerns?

If movers consistently complain about underpriced quotes, or customers abandon quotes (too expensive), adjust the multipliers:

```typescript
// Tunable parameters in api.ts
const BASE = 12000        // Increase if all quotes too low
const DISTANCE_RATE = 1500 // Per 10km - adjust based on fuel costs
const LABOR_BASE = 4000    // Per crew member - adjust based on wages
const ITEM_RATE = 600      // Per inventory item - adjust based on handling time
const SERVICE_RATE = 1500  // Per add-on service - adjust based on costs
```

Start conservative (slightly higher prices), then lower as you collect data. Easier to reduce prices than explain surprise increases!

**Good luck with the launch! üöö**
