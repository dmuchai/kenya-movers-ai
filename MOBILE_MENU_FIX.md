## 🐛 If Sign-Out Still Doesn't Show

### **Check Chrome DevTools Logs:**
```bash
# Connect device via USB with USB debugging enabled
# Open Chrome on your computer
# Go to: chrome://inspect
# Click "Inspect" on your device
# Look for console logs:
```

**Expected logs when opening menu:**
```
Mobile menu opened. User state: Logged in
User email: your-email@example.com
```

**If you see:**
```
Mobile menu opened. User state: Not logged in
User email: undefined
```

**Then the issue is authentication state not being detected.**

### **Potential Fixes:**
1. **Clear app data:**
   - Settings → Apps → MoveLink → Storage → Clear Data
   - Reinstall app
   - Sign in again

2. **Check environment variables:**
   - Ensure `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` is set
   - Ensure `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` is set
   - Rebuild app if env vars were missing

3. **Check network connection:**
   - App needs internet to verify authentication
   - Try on WiFi and mobile data
