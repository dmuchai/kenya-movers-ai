## ⚙️ Setup Required

### 1. Create Storage Buckets in Supabase Dashboard

```sql
-- Go to Supabase Dashboard → Storage

-- Create bucket: mover-profiles (public)
-- Create bucket: mover-documents (private, only accessible by admins)
```

### 2. Configure Storage Policies

```sql
-- mover-profiles bucket (public read)
CREATE POLICY "Public read access"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
USING (bucket_id = 'mover-profiles');

CREATE POLICY "Authenticated upload"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'mover-profiles' AND auth.uid() IS NOT NULL);

-- mover-documents bucket (private)
CREATE POLICY "Admin read access"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
USING (
  bucket_id = 'mover-documents' 
  AND auth.uid() IN (
    SELECT id FROM auth.users WHERE raw_user_meta_data->>'role' = 'admin'
  )
);

### 3. Add Routes to Your App

Add these routes to your router configuration:

```typescript
import MoverRegistration from '@/pages/MoverRegistration';
import AdminVerification from '@/pages/AdminVerification';
import CreateBooking from '@/pages/CreateBooking';
import FindMovers from '@/pages/FindMovers';

// In your routes:
{
  path: '/mover-registration',
  element: <MoverRegistration />
},
{
  path: '/admin-verification',
  element: <AdminVerification />
},
{
  path: '/create-booking',
  element: <CreateBooking />
},
{
  path: '/find-movers',
  element: <FindMovers />
}
```

### 4. Google Places API (Optional Enhancement)

The `LocationAutocomplete` component already exists. If you want enhanced geocoding:

```typescript
// Add to .env.local
VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_key_here

// Update locationService.ts reverseGeocode function
// to use Google Geocoding API
```

## 📊 Database Schema Used

### Tables
- ✅ `movers` - Complete registration data
- ✅ `bookings` - Customer requests
- ✅ `booking_requests` - Quote system (Phase 2)
- ✅ `payments` - Ready for M-Pesa (Phase 4)
- ✅ `ratings` - Two-way reviews (Phase 3)

### Functions
- ✅ `find_nearby_movers(location, radius, min_rating)` - PostGIS spatial search
- ⏳ `calculate_distance_km()` - Client-side implementation used instead
- ⏳ `is_location_in_service_area()` - Not yet used
- ⏳ `get_mover_stats()` - Not yet used
- ⏳ `get_platform_stats()` - Not yet used

### Storage Buckets (Need to Create)
- ⚠️ `mover-profiles` - Profile images (public read)
- ⚠️ `mover-documents` - Verification docs (private)

---

## 🎯 Next Steps (Phase 2)

Now that Phase 1 is complete, you can start Phase 2:

### Phase 2: Booking & Matching (Months 3-4)

1. **Quote System**
   - Movers receive booking notifications
   - Movers submit quotes
   - Customers compare and select quotes
   - Uses `booking_requests` table

2. **Real-time Notifications**
   - Push notifications for new bookings
   - Email notifications
   - SMS via Africa's Talking

3. **In-App Messaging**
   - Customer-Mover chat
   - Real-time with Supabase Realtime
   - File attachments

4. **Booking Management**
   - Accept/reject bookings
   - Reschedule requests
   - Cancellation policies

---

## 🐛 Known Limitations

### Current Implementations:
1. **Booking Number Generation**
   - Currently client-side (`BK-${timestamp}`)
   - Should migrate to database trigger

2. **Distance Calculation**
   - Using Haversine formula (client-side)
   - Could use PostGIS RPC for server-side

3. **Price Estimation**
   - Simple formula (100 KES/km × multiplier)
   - Phase 2 will add dynamic pricing

4. **Mover Search Results**
   - Returns limited mover data
   - Full profiles require additional query

5. **Document Verification**
   - Manual admin approval
   - Could add AI verification in future
